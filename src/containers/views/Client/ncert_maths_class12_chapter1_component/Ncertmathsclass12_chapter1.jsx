							</p>
							<p>
								The details of all the chapters included in Maths Class 11 NCERT
								Solutions are provided below:
							</p>

							<h4>NCERT Solutions Maths Chapter 1 Class 11 Sets</h4>
							<p>
								A set is defined as the characterized accumulation of the
								various items. Sets are an integral part of modern-day
								Mathematics. The concepts of relations and functions are
								characterised by using sets. Learning of sets also aids in the
								understanding of the concepts of sequences, probability,
								geometry and more. This chapter provides hypotheses to deal with
								sets consistently. Students need a good grasp of this chapter
								for the understanding of more complex concepts.
							</p>

							<h4>
								Maths NCERT Solutions Class 11 Chapter 2 Relations and Functions
							</h4>
							<p>
								An upgrade on Sets, Relations and Functions explores the idea of
								linking pairs of objects from two different sets and then
								deriving relations between the said objects of the pair. Certain
								relations qualify as functions, a crucial concept in Mathematics
								for its capturing of the idea of two quantities corresponding
								with each other and the correspondence is mathematically
								precise. All this and much more has been explained in a fun and
								creative way in this chapter.
							</p>

							<h4>
								Class 11 Maths NCERT Solutions Chapter 3 Trigonometric Functions
							</h4>
							<p>
								This chapter generalises the concepts of trigonometric ratios to
								trigonometric functions along with the study of their
								properties. Students get to explore the dynamic world of
								trigonometry as they attempt and solve the various numerical
								problems provided in this chapter.
							</p>

							<h4>
								NCERT Solutions Maths Class 11 Chapter 4 Principle of
								Mathematical Induction
							</h4>
							<p>
								With just one exercise, this chapter can prove to be quite
								interesting for students who have a knack for Mathematical
								induction. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the concepts as
								they are useful in higher studies as well.
							</p>

							<h4>
								NCERT Solutions for Class 11 Maths Chapter 5 Complex Numbers and
								Quadratic Equations
							</h4>
							<p>
								The framework of real numbers is stretched to complex numbers to
								accommodate the square root of negative numbers. The concept of
								complex numbers finds a profound use in higher Mathematics, so
								ensure that you are thorough with all the concepts included in
								the chapter.
							</p>

							<h4>
								NCERT Solutions Maths Chapter 6 Class 11 Linear Inequalities
							</h4>
							<p>
								A very important chapter from an examination point of view, this
								chapter can also prove to be very interesting if you are
								thorough with all the concepts. Two quantities are more often
								unequal than equivalent. The concepts and exercises included in
								this chapter will open up your mind to how inequalities are a
								part of everyday life.
							</p>

							<h4>
								NCERT Class 11 Maths Solutions Chapter 7 Permutations and
								Combinations
							</h4>
							<p>
								Students in this chapter are introduced to the advance concepts
								of permutation and combinations which are a crucial part of
								learning mathematics as their applications are found in many
								other fields as well. There are a total of 4 exercises in this
								chapter with 31 questions based on the concepts of Permutations
								and Combinations.
							</p>

							<h4>NCERT Solutions Chapter 8 Class 11 Binomial Theorem</h4>
							<p>
								Persian Mathematician Omar Khayyam, in the 11th century,
								provided the general formula for (a + b)^n, where n is a
								positive whole number. This equation or its expansion has been
								provided in this chapter Binomial hypothesis.
							</p>

							<h4>
								NCERT Solutions Class 11 Maths Chapter 9 Sequences and Series
							</h4>
							<p>
								The topics of Geometric Progression, Arithmetic Progression,
								General Term of a G.P, Sum to n terms of a G.P etc., are
								included in the chapter Sequence and Series. This chapter
								carries a high weightage in the exam. So make sure to practise
								all the exercises included.
							</p>

							<h4>Class 11 Maths Chapter 10 NCERT Solutions Straight Lines</h4>
							<p>
								In this chapter, you will study some important topics like the
								Slope of a line, the angle between two lines, Collinearity
								between two points, horizontal and vertical lines and much more.
								Make sure you practise sums from all the three exercises
								included in this chapter.
